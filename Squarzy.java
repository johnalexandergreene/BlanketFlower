/*
 * 
 * A grid of square cells
 * Each cell is graphically significant. Span around 1/2 or 1/4 C-interval.
 * we throw intelligent cell ops at the grid. 
 *   Each intelligent cell op throwing algorithm is called an AGENT
 * 
 * Examples of cell ops :
 *   noise
 *   cellular automaton
 *   mathy stuff
 *   stripes 
 *   grammarly polygon differentiation ( like forsythia except with square griddy geometry )
 *   
 * ----
 * 
 * So you have a GRID and some AGENTS
 * you invoke the agents upon the grid...
 *   sequentially? 
 *   how do you mix them?
 *   good question.
 *     a protocol for cell identification, definition, modification, tagging etc
 *     it can handle multiple agents. Mixes them together into a grid-state.
 *
